# Lab 4 - Prompt Quizzer: A Quiz Game

## Problem Statement
Create a simple JavaScript quiz game that runs entirely in the browser console. The game uses a predefined set of questions stored in an array, loops through them, prompts the user for input, and provides immediate feedback. The final score is displayed at the end.

## Features
- Uses arrays, loops, conditionals, and functions
- Input handled with `prompt()`
- Feedback shown with `alert()`
- Input normalized with `toLowerCase()` and `trim()`
- Score tracked and displayed at the end

## How to Run
1. Open your browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
2. Press **F12** → Go to **Console**.
3. Copy and paste the contents of `quiz.js`.
4. Press **Enter** → The quiz starts immediately.

## Improvements (Optional)
- Add more questions
- Multiple-choice options
- Timer for each question
- Store high scores using localStorage
- Restart option or score-based feedback

## Submission
- Push `quiz.js` and `README.md` to your GitHub repository.
- Share the repository link with faculty.
